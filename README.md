# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Aphex Twin Music Generator

An interactive music creation app inspired by Aphex Twin's style and modeled on Korg instrumentation.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**
  - Play notes and share them with other connected users via Socket.IO
- **Spray Paint Background**
  - Unique visual style that complements the experimental nature of the app
- **Responsive Design**
  - Built with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern interface

## Optimization

- Efficient audio processing with Tone.js
- Reduced latency with optimized Socket.IO configurations
- Lazy loading of heavy modules
- Minimal React state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
