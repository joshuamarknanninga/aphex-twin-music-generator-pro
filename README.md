Features
Modular Synthesizer
Visual Interface: Node-based modular synthesizer allowing custom sound patch creation.
Custom Patching: Add, remove, and connect modules like oscillators, filters, envelopes, and effects in real-time.
Module Library: Includes oscillators (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle), filters (low-pass, high-pass), LFOs, envelopes, and effects (reverb, delay, distortion).
Advanced Sample Manipulation
Waveform Visualization: Interact directly with the waveform using WaveSurfer.js.
Time Stretching and Pitch Shifting: Adjust playback speed and pitch independently.
Slicing and Looping: Slice samples into segments and set custom loop points.
Granular Synthesis: Manipulate samples at the micro-level with granular techniques.
Glitch Effects
Bitcrusher: Apply digital distortion by reducing audio resolution.
Stutter Effect: Create rhythmic stuttering sounds by repeating small audio portions.
Reverse Playback: Play audio segments in reverse for experimental textures.
Granular Controls: Adjust grain size and overlap for granular synthesis.
Real-Time Controls: Immediate auditory feedback when adjusting glitch parameters.
Vocoder Integration
Audio Input: Use your microphone to input voice or sounds.
Vocoder Processing: Merge vocal characteristics with synthesized sounds.
Parameter Controls: Adjust harmonicity, Q factor, and base frequency in real-time.
Virtual Piano Keyboard
Interactive Keyboard: Play notes by clicking on keys spanning multiple octaves.
Keyboard Controls: Visual feedback when keys are pressed.
Customizable Key Mappings: Map computer keyboard keys to notes.
32-Step Sequencer
Pattern Programming: Create sequences over 32 steps with adjustable BPM.
Grid Interface: Toggle notes on/off in a visual grid.
Real-Time Playback: Hear sequences as you program and modify them.
Advanced Synthesis Controls
Oscillator Types: Choose from sine, square, sawtooth, and triangle waveforms.
Filter Adjustments: Modify frequency and resonance.
Envelope Controls: Adjust attack, decay, sustain, and release.
Effects: Add reverb, delay, and other effects.
Sample Loading
User Samples: Upload and manipulate your own audio samples.
Sample Playback: Play samples through the synthesizer with effects.
Cassette Tape Emulation
Vintage Effects: Emulate the warm, nostalgic sound of cassette tapes.
Adjustable Parameters: Control the intensity of the tape effect.
Customization Options
Key Bindings: Customize key bindings for notes and controls.
Settings Menu: User-friendly interface for modifying preferences.
Persistent Settings: Preferences are saved across sessions.
Expanded Keyboard Controls
Comprehensive Mapping: Use letters, numbers, and characters to control the app.
Alternative Input Methods: Use the computer keyboard when MIDI is unavailable.
MIDI Support
External Controllers: Connect MIDI devices to control the synthesizer.
Real-Time Input: Play notes and adjust parameters using MIDI.
Dynamic Mapping: Basic mappings included; future updates may allow customization.
Audio Export
Recording Sessions: Record live sessions with all sounds and effects.
Downloadable Files: Download recordings in WAV format.
Playback Controls: Listen to recordings before downloading.
Performance Optimization
Efficient Audio Processing: Reduced latency and CPU usage.
Resource Management: Proper disposal of audio nodes.
Optimized Rendering: Minimizes unnecessary re-renders.
Cross-Browser Compatibility
Enhanced Support: Works across all major browsers, even without Web MIDI API.
Feature Detection: Adjusts functionality based on browser capabilities.
User Notification: Informs users of any limitations.
Real-Time Collaboration
Socket.IO Integration: Real-time sharing of notes and sequences.
Synchronization: Synchronized playback and interactions among users.
Responsive Design
Tailwind CSS: Ensures the app is responsive on various devices.
Mobile Compatibility: Usable on tablets and larger mobile devices.
SaaS Platform Features
User Authentication
Secure Sign-Up and Login: Create accounts with email and password.
Authentication Tokens: Secure session management with JWT.
Password Security: Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
Project Management
Save and Load Projects: Access your work from any device.
Version Control: Keep track of changes with basic versioning.
Cloud Storage: Securely stored projects and data.
User Profiles and Settings
Personalized Experience: Save preferences and custom settings.
Profile Management: Update personal information and account settings.
Collaboration Tools
Project Sharing: Share projects via links.
Future Enhancements: Plans for real-time multi-user collaboration.
Scalability and Multi-Tenancy
Efficient Resource Management: Handles multiple users efficiently.
Data Isolation: Secure and separate user data.
